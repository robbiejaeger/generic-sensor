# Generic Sensor API Demo

This is a demonstration of the [Generic Sensor API](https://www.w3.org/TR/generic-sensor/). This specific example 
uses the `Accelerometer` sensor to show the acceleration of a device in the X, Y, and Z directions.

The JavaScript code specific to the accelerometer can be found in `/public/scripts.js`, [here](https://github.com/robbiejaeger/generic-sensor/blob/master/public/scripts.js#L16-L49).

The demo will only work on devices that have accelerometers and use Chrome version 67 or higher.
