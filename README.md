# Generic Sensor API Demo

This is a demonstration of the [Generic Sensor API](https://www.w3.org/TR/generic-sensor/). This specific example 
uses the `Accelerometer` sensor to show the acceleration of a device in the X, Y, and Z directions.

The demo will only work on devices that have accelerometers and use Chrome version 67 or higher.
